Hello World, welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site will serve as a hub for my projects, journey, and other endeavors I will be taking. I figured everyone has a website why shouldn't I?

I chose GitHub Pages for hosting because it's fast, free(very important to a student like myself), and accessible. For styling, I went with Tailwind CSS as it is modern and minimalistic, which aligns with my design philosophy.

Building this site was a great learning experience as I haven't ever had the opportunity to do anything web related! Now that I have these basic skills I plant to use them building some upcoming projects of mine!

I highly recommend checking out [Tailpages](https://github.com/harrywang/tailpages)

Stay tuned for more updates as I add new projects and insights!
