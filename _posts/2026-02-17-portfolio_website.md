<h1>Overview</h1>

[Github Repository Here](https://github.com/wraymscott/wraymscott.git)

Hello World, welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site will serve as a hub for my projects, journey, and other endeavors I will be taking. I figured everyone has a website why shouldn't I?

<h1>Process</h1>

In modern times it actually isn't all that difficult to build a website, there are so many great tools to get started. You don't even need to know a lick of coding!

I personally used [Tailpages](https://github.com/harrywang/tailpages), I didn't want to re-invent the wheel but I still wanted to get into the nitty gritty details of web devolopement. Tailpages uses a tailwind css which I prefer as it is very minamilstic and clean to work with. 

<h1>Outcomes</h1>

I finally got to dip my toes in html! and I got to learn the basics of markdown files. I think this will help me out with some of my future projects along with improving my git documentation.

Hopefully this is the first of many many projects to come!
