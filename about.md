I’m Wray Scott, I currently attend Washington State University with the intent to get my Bachelor's in Computer Science. Among my many many hobbies I enjoy graphics programming, electronics, and gaming. I’m also a fan of geography and reading, particularly Vogon poetry.

## Roadmap

I'm working on releasing a plethora of project, ranging from one-day builds to ambitious endeavours. For projects that I feel are note worthing I will also be creating videos to document my process.
